IKEA Tradfri MDNS DoS PoC code

Tradfri gateways seem to crash when they receive a bunch of empty MDNS packets.

## How to use

Set your gateway IP in the exploit code and run the code. Maybe you have to increase the number of loops.

## Which versions are vulnerable?

Up to 1.3.x

## Will the code be released?

Let's IKEA give the chance to fix this issue.
